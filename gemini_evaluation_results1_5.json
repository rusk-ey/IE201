        "gemini_response": "To determine the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 4, it is helpful to look at the relationship between the payments made and how they are allocated toward the loan.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the total amount paid toward the loan in a given year. In your table, this represents the \"fixed annual payments\" mentioned in the story.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the portion of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** that goes toward covering the interest that has accrued.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This represents the portion of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** that is used to reduce the actual balance of the loan, rather than just paying off the interest.\n\n### 2. General Principle and Formula\nThe **PPmt (Principal Payment)** is typically calculated by taking the total payment made and subtracting the portion used for interest:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad (Loan Payment)} - \\text{IPmt (Interest Payment)}$$\n\n### 3. Reasoning and Context\nTo find the value for Year 4, you should consider the following details from the **Horizon Tech** story:\n*   **The Deferment Period:** The story states that \"all payments are deferred for the first 5 years.\" During a deferment period, the borrower is not required to make any annual payments.\n*   **The Loan Payment (Ad):** Look at the value for **Ad** in Year 4 in your table. If the company is still within the deferment period, how much are they paying out of pocket?\n\n### 4. Example from Other Rows\nIf you look at **Year 1**:\n*   The **Ad (Loan Payment)** is 0 because it is the first year of the deferment period.\n*   The **IPmt (Interest Payment)** is 0 because no payment was made to cover the accrued interest.\n*   Following the formula ($\\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt} = \\text{PPmt}$), the calculation would be $0 - 0 = 0$. Therefore, the **PPmt** for Year 1 is 0.\n\n### 5. Hint for Year 4\nCheck the **Ad (Loan Payment)** column for Year 4. Since Horizon Tech is still in the period where \"all payments are deferred,\" use that value to determine if any funds are available to be applied as a **PPmt (Principal Payment)**. If the total payment is zero, what does that mean for the reduction of the principal?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that helps the student understand how to calculate the PPmt without directly giving the answer. It correctly defines the relevant variables (Ad, IPmt, PPmt) using the exact terminology from the problem and loan table. The formula for PPmt is provided, and the reasoning about the deferment period is well integrated, helping the student connect the story context to the table values. The example from Year 1 effectively illustrates the calculation method without revealing the Year 4 solution. The language is clear, professional, and consistent with the vocabulary used in the scenario. The response avoids any disallowed terminology and sticks strictly to the approved phrasing.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for a slight redundancy in explaining IPmt as zero in Year 1, which could be confusing since the table shows IPmt as zero because no payment was made, but interest still accrued as unpaid interest. However, this does not violate any rules or mislead significantly. Overall, this is a strong, helpful, and rule-compliant response that guides the student effectively."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 3, you need to understand how the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is distributed between interest and the balance of the loan.\n\n### Key Definitions and Reasoning\nIn this repayment schedule, the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is the fixed amount paid each year once the deferment period ends. This payment is used to cover two things:\n1.  **IPmt (Interest Payment)**: The portion of your payment that covers the interest that has accrued.\n2.  **PPmt (Principal Payment)**: The remaining portion of the payment that actually reduces the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n\n### The Formula\nThe general relationship between these values is:\n**PPmt = Ad - IPmt**\n\nIn other words, the **Principal Payment** is whatever is left of your **Loan Payment** after the **Interest Payment** has been subtracted.\n\n### Example from Year 4\nYou can see this principle in action by looking at the values provided for Year 4:\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment)**: $3,380.07\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment)**: $620.93\n*   By subtracting the **IPmt** from the **Ad** ($3,380.07 - $620.93), we arrive at the **PPmt** of $2,759.14.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **PPmt** for Year 3:\n1.  Identify the **Ad (Loan Payment)** for that year (this is the fixed annual payment mentioned in the story).\n2.  Identify the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for Year 3 from the table. Note that in Year 3, the **IPmt** is equal to the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** because this is the first payment being made after the deferment period.\n3.  Subtract the **IPmt** from the **Ad** to find your **PPmt**.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, step-by-step explanation without directly calculating the PPmt for Year 3. It uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario (PPmt, Ad, IPmt, UB) and references the loan table appropriately, especially by using Year 4 as an example to illustrate the formula. The explanation of the relationship PPmt = Ad - IPmt is correct and helps the student understand how to approach the problem independently. The hint about IPmt equaling UIB in Year 3 is a helpful insight that aligns with the story context and the table data.\n\nThe language is clear, concise, and matches the financial engineering context without introducing any disallowed terminology or phrasing. The response avoids giving the direct answer, instead guiding the student to apply the formula and interpret the table values themselves.\n\nThe only minor improvement could be to emphasize that the student should carefully check the values in the table for Year 3 before applying the formula, but this is a subtle point and does not detract from the overall quality.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent educational response that respects all constraints and effectively supports student learning."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 6, you need to understand how the total debt accumulates before the annual payment is applied.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This is the amount of debt carried over from the end of the previous year. For Year 6, the **UB** is equal to the **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** from Year 5.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This represents the interest that accrues on the **UB** during the current year based on the annual interest rate.\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This is the total balance of the loan (principal plus the interest for that year) just before the startup makes its annual **Ad (Loan Payment)**.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **AO**, you can use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\nAlternatively, since interest is calculated based on the balance:\n$$\\text{Int} = \\text{UB} \\times \\text{annual interest rate}$$\nTherefore:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + (\\text{UB} \\times \\text{annual interest rate})$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at how **AO** was determined for **Year 4**:\n1.  The **UB** for Year 4 was the **UBA** from Year 3, which was **$2,540.13**.\n2.  The **Int** for Year 4 was calculated by multiplying that balance by the 5.00% interest rate: \n    *   $2,540.13 \\times 0.05 = \\$127.01$.\n3.  The **AO** was the sum of these two values:\n    *   $\\$2,540.13 \\text{ (UB)} + \\$127.01 \\text{ (Int)} = \\$2,667.14$.\n\n### Hints for Year 6\n*   **Step 1:** Look at the table for Year 5. Find the value for **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)**. This will be your **UB** for Year 6.\n*   **Step 2:** Calculate the **Int** for Year 6 by multiplying your Year 6 **UB** by the annual interest rate of 5.00% (or 0.05).\n*   **Step 3:** Add your results from Step 1 and Step 2 together to find the **AO** for Year 6. \n\nBy following these steps, you will see the total amount the startup owes at the end of the final year before they make their final **Loan Payment**.",

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 4, you need to look at how interest accumulates over time, especially during and immediately after the deferment period.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total amount of interest that has accumulated on the loan up to the point just before you make your annual **Loan Payment (Ad)**.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the amount of interest that remains unpaid after the previous year's payment has been applied.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** In the context of this table, this represents the interest that accrued during the current year, calculated based on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of the year and the annual interest rate of 9.00%.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **UIB** for any given year is the sum of any interest that was left over from the previous year plus the new interest that accrued during the current year. Because the first 3 years of this loan involve a deferment period where no payments are made, the interest is not paid off and instead continues to build up.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for Year 4, use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{UIB (Year 4)} = \\text{UIA (Year 3)} + \\text{Int (Year 4)}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at how **UIB** was calculated for **Year 2** to see this principle in action:\n1.  In **Year 1**, the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** was **$1,710.0**.\n2.  In **Year 2**, the interest that accrued during the year (**Int**) was **$1,863.9**.\n3.  By adding the previous interest (**$1,710.0**) and the current interest (**$1,863.9**), we get the **UIB for Year 2**, which is **$3,573.9**.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the value for your blank:\n1.  Locate the **UIA** value from the end of **Year 3**.\n2.  Locate the **Int** value calculated for **Year 4**.\n3.  Combine these two values to determine the total interest waiting to be addressed before the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is applied in Year 4. \n\nNote that in Year 4, the startup finally begins its repayment schedule, so this total interest will be the first thing addressed by the **Loan Payment (Ad)**.",

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 4, you need to understand how the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is distributed between interest and the balance of the loan.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the fixed annual payment of $5,515.68 made by Horizon Tech during the repayment schedule.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This represents the portion of your annual payment that covers the interest that has accrued.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This is the portion of your annual payment that is applied toward reducing the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nWhen a company makes a **Loan Payment (Ad)**, the money is first used to pay off any interest owed (**IPmt**). Whatever remains from that payment is the **Principal Payment (PPmt)**, which reduces the actual debt.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **PPmt**, use the following equation:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad (Loan Payment)} - \\text{IPmt (Interest Payment)}$$\n\n### Example from Year 3\nYou can see this principle in action by looking at Year 3 of the table:\n1.  The **Ad (Loan Payment)** was **$5,515.68**.\n2.  The **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for that year was **$1,719.14**.\n3.  By subtracting the interest from the total payment ($5,515.68 - $1,719.14$), we arrive at the **PPmt** of **$3,796.54**.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the missing **PPmt** for Year 4, look at the values already provided in the Year 4 row for the **Ad (Loan Payment)** and the **IPmt (Interest Payment)**. Apply the same subtraction method used in the Year 3 example to determine how much of the Year 4 payment goes toward the principal.",

This payment is used first to cover the **Interest Payment (IPmt)**, which includes all interest that accrued during the deferment period plus the current year's interest. The remaining amount of that payment is the **Principal Payment (PPmt)**, which reduces the actual balance of the loan.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** during the repayment phase:\n$$\\text{UBA} = \\text{UB} - \\text{PPmt}$$\n\n### Variable Definitions\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This represents the outstanding amount of the loan at the start of the year. For Year 3, this is the balance after interest accrued during the **deferment period**.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This is the specific portion of the **Loan Payment (Ad)** that is applied toward the loan balance. It is calculated by taking the total **Loan Payment (Ad)** and subtracting the **Interest Payment (IPmt)**.\n\n### Example from Year 4\nYou can see how this logic works by looking at the calculations for Year 4:\n1.  **UB (Unpaid Balance)** for Year 4 is $7,952.43.\n2.  **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 4 is $7,952.42.\n3.  **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** is calculated as:\n    $$\\$7,952.43 (\\text{UB}) - \\$7,952.42 (\\text{PPmt}) = \\$0.01 (\\text{UBA})$$\n    *(Note: The $0.01 is a result of minor rounding over the loan term.)*\n\n### Hints for Year 3\nTo find the missing value for Year 3:\n1.  Locate the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** for Year 3 in the table. This is the amount the startup owed at the beginning of the repayment phase.\n2.  Locate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 3.

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **AO** (Amount Owed) for Year 4, you should focus on the relationship between the balance remaining from the previous year and the interest that has accrued during the current year.\n\n### Definition of Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This is the amount of the loan that remains unpaid at the start of the year.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This represents the interest that accrues on the **UB** during the year based on the annual interest rate of 10.00%.\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This is the total value of the loan at a specific point in time during the year, specifically after interest has been added but before the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is applied.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nIn this repayment schedule, the **AO** is determined by taking the balance you started the year with and adding the interest that was charged for that period. This reflects the total obligation to the lender before you make your fixed annual payment.\n\n### Formula\nTo find the **AO** for any given year, you can use the following equation:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 5** to see how this principle is applied:\n1.  The **UB** (Unpaid Balance) at the start of Year 5 is **$6,043.35**.\n2.  The **Int** (Interest Payment) accrued during Year 5 is **$604.34**.\n3.  By adding these together ($6,043.35 + $604.34$), we arrive at the **AO** for Year 5, which is **$6,647.69**.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the **AO** for Year 4, identify the **UB** and the **Int** values specifically listed for Year 4 in your table. Summing these two figures will give you the total **Amount Owed** before the company makes its fixed annual payment of $3,482.13.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and effectively guides the student without providing the direct answer. It clearly defines the relevant variables using the exact terminology from the scenario, explains the financial principle behind the calculation of AO, and provides the correct formula. The example from Year 5 is well chosen and clearly demonstrates the method without revealing the Year 4 AO value. The hint at the end encourages the student to apply the same reasoning to Year 4, fostering understanding and independent problem-solving. The language is clear, professional, and consistent with the vocabulary used in the scenario. There is no use of disallowed terminology or phrasing outside the approved examples.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is because the response could have emphasized more explicitly that the interest rate of 10% is applied to the UB to get Int, reinforcing the connection between the interest rate and the interest payment. However, this is a small point and does not detract significantly from the overall quality.  \n\nOverall, this is a strong, helpful, and compliant educational response."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 2, you need to consider how interest accumulates during and after the deferment period.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** In this table, this column represents the interest that has accrued during the current year based on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of the year.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the interest that remains unpaid after the **Ad (Loan Payment)** has been applied at the end of the previous year.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total amount of interest that has accumulated up to the moment just before the annual payment is made.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **UIB** represents the \"pool\" of interest currently owed. It consists of any interest that was not paid off in the previous year plus the new interest that accrued during the current year.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for any year ($n$), use the following equation:\n$$\\text{UIB}_n = \\text{UIA}_{n-1} + \\text{Int}_n$$\n\n### Example Calculation (Year 3)\nWe can see how this works by looking at Year 3:\n1.  Locate the **UIA** from the previous year (Year 2), which is **0.0**.\n2.  Locate the **Int** for the current year (Year 3), which is **1827.32**.\n3.  Add them together: $0.0 + 1827.32 = 1827.32$.\n4.  This matches the **UIB** recorded for Year 3.\n\n### Hint for your Blank (Year 2)\nTo find the **UIB** for Year 2:\n*   Look at the **UIA** at the end of Year 1. Because the startup was in a deferment period and the **Ad (Loan Payment)** was \\$0, some interest remained unpaid.\n*   Look at the **Int** for Year 2 (2319.9).\n*   Combine the interest carried over from the deferment year with the new interest from Year 2.\n\n**Reasoning Check:** You can verify your result by looking at the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 2. The **AO** is the sum of the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** and the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)**. If your calculated **UIB** plus the **UB** (21090.0) equals the **AO** (23409.9), your calculation is correct.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that helps the student understand how to calculate the UIB for Year 2 without giving the direct answer. It correctly uses the vocabulary and terminology from the scenario, such as UB, Int, UIA, UIB, Ad, and AO, and avoids any disallowed terminology. The explanation includes the relevant formula, definitions of variables, a concrete example from Year 3 to illustrate the method, and a hint specific to Year 2. The reasoning check using AO is a helpful tip for self-verification.

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** for Year 6, you need to understand how the loan transitions from the deferment period into the **repayment phase**. \n\nIn Year 6, Horizon Tech begins making its **fixed annual payments** of $6,122.62. This payment is first used to cover the interest that has accumulated.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance)**: The total amount remaining on the loan from the previous year. For Year 6, this is the **UBA** from Year 5.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment)**: The interest that accrues on the **UB** during the current year.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)**: The sum of any interest carried over from previous years plus the interest that accrued in the current year.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment)**: The amount paid toward the loan this year. During the **repayment schedule**, this is $6,122.62.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)**: The amount of interest remaining after the **Ad** has been applied to the **UIB**.\n\n### General Principles and Equations\n1.  **Calculate the Interest for the year (Int)**:\n    $$\\text{Int} = \\text{UB} \\times \\text{Annual Interest Rate}$$\n    *Example from Year 4*: The **UB** was $9,065.20. With an interest rate of 9.00% ($0.09$): $9,065.20 \\times 0.09 = 815.87$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)**:\n    $$\\text{UIB} = \\text{UIA (from previous year)} + \\text{Int (current year)}$$\n    *Example from Year 5*: The **UIA** from Year 4 was $2,881.07$ and the **Int** for Year 5 was $889.30$. Adding them gives a **UIB** of $3,770.37$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Unpaid Interest After Payment (UIA)**:\n    $$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{Ad}$$\n    *Note*: During the deferment years (1-5), the **Ad** was $0$, so the **UIA** was equal to the **UIB**. In Year 6, you will finally subtract the **fixed annual payment** of $6,122.62$ from the interest total. If the payment is greater than the **UIB**, the **UIA** becomes $0.00$, and the remaining portion of the payment is then applied to the principal.\n\n### Hint for Year 6\nTo find the **UIA** for Year 6:\n1. Identify the **UB** for Year 6 (which is the **UBA** from Year 5).\n2. Calculate the **Int** for Year 6 by multiplying that balance by 0.09.\n3. Add that **Int** to the **UIA** from Year 5 to find the **UIB** for Year 6.\n4. Subtract the **Ad** ($6,122.62$) from your **UIB**. If the result is negative, it means all interest is paid, and the **UIA** is simply $0.00$.",
