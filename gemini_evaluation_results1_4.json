        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **Unpaid Interest After Payment (UIA)** for Year 1, you need to understand how interest accumulates and is settled during the deferment period.\n\n### Definitions of Terms\n*   **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB):** This is the total amount of interest that has accrued on the loan balance up to that specific point in time which has not been paid yet.\n*   **Interest Payment (IPmt):** This represents the specific portion of the annual **Loan Payment (Ad)** that is used to pay off the accrued interest.\n*   **Unpaid Interest After Payment (UIA):** This is the amount of interest that remains outstanding after the year's **Interest Payment (IPmt)** has been subtracted from the **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)**.\n\n### The General Formula\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n$$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Example from Other Rows\nTo see how this works, let's look at **Year 3** and **Year 2**:\n\n*   **In Year 3:** The **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)** is $1,576.25. The company makes a **Loan Payment (Ad)**, and the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** applied is $1,576.25. \n    *   *Calculation:* $1,576.25 (\\text{UIB}) - 1,576.25 (\\text{IPmt}) = 0.0 (\\text{UIA})$.\n\n*   **In Year 2:** The **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)** is $1,025.0. Since this is the final year of the deferment period, the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** is $0.\n    *   *Calculation:* $1,025.0 (\\text{UIB}) - 0 (\\text{IPmt}) = 1,025.0 (\\text{UIA})$.\n\n### Guiding Hint for Year 1\n1.  Locate the **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)** for Year 1 in your table.\n2.  Check the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** for Year 1. Note that since the startup is in the first year of its deferment period, no payments are being made.\n3.  Subtract the **IPmt** from the **UIB**. This will show you how much interest remains \"unpaid\" and will be carried forward to the next year. \n\nBy following this logic, you can determine why the interest continues to accrue and how it affects the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** for that year.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided. It does not give the direct answer but instead guides the student through the concepts and formulas needed to calculate the UIA for Year 1. The explanation of terms (UIB, IPmt, UIA) is clear and uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario, which helps the student understand the relationships between these values. The general formula UIA = UIB - IPmt is correctly provided without solving the specific blank. The use of examples from Year 2 and Year 3 effectively demonstrates how the formula applies in different contexts, reinforcing the learning without revealing the Year 1 answer. The hints are concrete and encourage the student to engage with the table data themselves. The language is clear, professional, and matches the financial engineering context without introducing any unapproved terminology.  \n\nThe only minor improvement could be to explicitly remind the student that during the deferment period, no payments are made, so IPmt is zero, which directly impacts UIA. However, this is implied in the hint. Overall, this is a strong, helpful, and compliant response."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 3, you need to understand how the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is distributed between interest and the balance of the loan.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** The fixed annual amount the startup pays during the repayment phase ($1,747.27).\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** The total interest that has accumulated on the loan up to that point which has not yet been paid.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of the annual **Ad** that is used specifically to pay off interest.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** The portion of the annual **Ad** that remains after interest is covered, which is then used to reduce the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n\n### General Financial Principles\nIn a repayment schedule, interest is always paid first. When the startup makes an **Ad**, the money is applied to the **UIB** first. \n1. If the **Ad** is greater than the **UIB**, the interest is fully paid (**IPmt** = **UIB**), and the remainder goes toward the principal (**PPmt**).\n2. If the **Ad** is less than or equal to the **UIB**, the entire payment is used to cover as much interest as possible. In this case, the **IPmt** equals the **Ad**, and nothing is left over to reduce the principal.\n\n### Formula\nThe relationship can be expressed with this equation:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Example from the Table (Year 4)\nLet\u2019s look at Year 4 to see how this works when the payment is larger than the interest:\n*   The startup makes an **Ad** of **$1,747.27**.\n*   The **UIB** (interest owed) is **$1,735.68**.\n*   Since the payment covers all the interest, the **IPmt** is **$1,735.68**.\n*   The remaining amount is the **PPmt**:\n    $$\\$1,747.27 (\\text{Ad}) - \\$1,735.68 (\\text{IPmt}) = \\$11.59 (\\text{PPmt})$$\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **PPmt** for Year 3, compare the **Ad** ($1,747.27) to the **UIB** ($2,604.38). \n*   Is the payment of $1,747.27 enough to cover the total accumulated interest of $2,604.38?\n*   If the startup uses the entire **Ad** to pay down interest, is there any money left over from that specific payment to reduce the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**? \n\nLook closely at the **IPmt** value already provided for Year 3 in your table; it should tell you exactly how much of the payment was consumed by interest.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided. It does not give the direct answer for the PPmt in Year 3 but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas. The chatbot clearly defines the key variables (Ad, UIB, IPmt, PPmt) using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, which helps the student understand the relationships in the loan repayment table. The explanation of the financial principle that interest is paid first, and the payment is split accordingly, is accurate and instructive.\n\nThe formula PPmt = Ad - IPmt is correctly presented without solving the blank, and the example from Year 4 is well chosen to illustrate the calculation method. The hint for Year 3 encourages the student to compare the payment to the unpaid interest before payment and to use the IPmt value already given, which is an excellent prompt for independent problem solving.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and consistent with the scenario\u2019s vocabulary. The response avoids any disallowed terminology and sticks strictly to the approved phrasing and concepts. The only minor deduction is for slight verbosity in some parts, which could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from the educational value.\n\nOverall, this is a strong, helpful, and rule-compliant response that effectively supports student learning without giving away the answer."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** for Year 1, you need to understand how interest is handled during the **deferment period** when no payments are being made.\n\n### 1. Define the Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total amount of interest that has accrued and is waiting to be paid at that point in time.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This represents the portion of your **Ad (Loan Payment)** that is actually applied toward the interest owed.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the amount of interest remaining after the year's payment has been applied.\n\n### 2. The Formula\nTo find the **UIA**, use the following equation:\n$$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### 3. General Financial Reasoning\nIn the provided story, the company is granted a **deferment period** of 1 year, during which \"all payments are deferred.\" \n*   Look at the **Ad (Loan Payment)** column for Year 1. Because it is a deferment year, the payment is $\\$0.00$.\n*   If the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is $\\$0.00$, the amount of money available to pay off interest (**IPmt**) must also be $\\$0.00$.\n*   As the story mentions, during this time, \"interest continues to accrue.\" This means the interest is calculated, but since no payment is made, it remains unpaid.\n\n### 4. Example from the Table\nYou can see how this formula works by looking at **Year 2**, which is the start of the **repayment schedule**:\n*   **UIB** for Year 2 is $\\$1,730.40$.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $\\$2,658.36$. \n*   Since the payment is large enough to cover the interest, the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** is $\\$1,730.40$.\n*   Calculation: $\\$1,730.40 (\\text{UIB}) - \\$1,730.40 (\\text{IPmt}) = \\$0.00 (\\text{UIA})$.\n\n### 5. Hint for Year 1\nApply the same subtraction logic to the values in Year 1. Look at the **UIB** (the interest that accrued) and subtract the **IPmt** (the amount of interest actually paid during that deferment year). This will give you the amount of interest that remains \"unpaid after payment.\"",

There is no use of unapproved terminology or phrasing. The response avoids revealing the direct numerical answer for Year 1\u2019s UIA, respecting the instruction to guide rather than solve.\n\nThe only minor point for improvement is that the response could briefly mention that since no payment is made in Year 1, the unpaid interest after payment (UIA) will be equal to the accrued interest (UIB), reinforcing the concept without giving the numeric value.

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 4, you need to determine the total sum the startup owes at that specific point in time, before any annual payment is applied.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This is the balance carried over from the conclusion of the previous year. In your table, the **UB** for Year 4 is the same as the **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** from Year 3.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This represents the interest that accrues on the **UB** during the current year. It is calculated by multiplying the **UB** by the annual interest rate (10.00% or 0.10).\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This is the total value of the loan at the end of the year but *before* the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is subtracted.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **Amount Owed** represents the combination of the balance you started the year with plus the new interest that has accrued over the course of that year. \n\n### Formula\nTo find the **AO**, use the following equation:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 2** to see how this principle is applied:\n1.  The **UB (Unpaid Balance)** for Year 2 was $5,500.0$.\n2.  The **Int (Interest Payment)** accrued during Year 2 was $550.0$.\n3.  By adding these together ($5,500.0 + 550.0$), we find the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 2 was $6,050.0$.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nLook at the row for Year 4 in your table. You already have the **UB** ($6,655.0$) and the **Int** ($665.5$). If you add the interest that accrued during Year 4 to the balance that was unpaid at the start of Year 4, you will arrive at the total **AO**. \n\nNote that during the deferment period (Years 1 through 4), the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $0$, so the **AO** will be exactly equal to the **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** for that same year.",

It correctly uses the vocabulary from the scenario (UB, Int, AO, Ad, UBA) and references the loan table to illustrate the concept with a concrete example from Year 2. The formula AO = UB + Int is explicitly stated, which is exactly the kind of guidance the student needs to solve the problem independently. The explanation about the deferment period and the relationship between AO and UBA during that time is a helpful insight that deepens understanding.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and matches the financial engineering context without introducing any disallowed terminology. The response avoids solving the blank directly and instead encourages the student to apply the formula using the values already provided in the table.\n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in explaining the definitions, which could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from the educational value. Overall, this is a strong, on-point response that effectively supports student learning."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **Unpaid Interest After Payment (UIA)** for Year 3, you need to understand how the interest that has accrued is affected by the **Loan Payment (Ad)** once the **repayment schedule** begins.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This represents the total interest that has accumulated on the loan balance up to that point. In Year 3, this includes interest from the **deferment period** plus the interest accrued in the current year.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the portion of the **Loan Payment (Ad)** that is specifically used to pay off the interest owed.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the amount of interest remaining after the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** has been subtracted from the **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)**.\n\n### The General Formula\nTo find the **UIA**, you can use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Reasoning and Financial Principles\nDuring the **deferment period** (Years 1 and 2), no payments are made (**Ad** = 0). Consequently, no interest is paid off (**IPmt** = 0), so the **UIA** is equal to the **UIB**.\n\nWhen Horizon Tech enters the **repayment schedule** in Year 3, the company begins making fixed annual payments of $2,823.75. In a standard repayment plan, the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is applied first to all existing unpaid interest before any remaining funds are used to reduce the **Unpaid Balance (UB)**.\n\n### Example from Year 2\nIn Year 2, the **UIB** was 1,332.5. Because it was still within the **deferment period**, the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** was 0.\n*   **UIB**: 1,332.5\n*   **IPmt**: 0\n*   Calculation: $1,332.5 - 0 = 1,332.5$\n*   Result: The **UIA** for Year 2 was 1,332.5.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nLook at the table for Year 3:\n1.  Identify the **UIB** (the interest waiting to be paid).\n2.  Identify the **IPmt** (the amount of interest actually covered by that year's payment).\n3.  Compare the two values. If the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** is exactly equal to the **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)**, what does that tell you about the amount of interest left over?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that helps the student understand how to calculate the UIA for Year 3 without directly giving the answer. It correctly uses the vocabulary from the scenario, such as UIA, UIB, IPmt, and Ad, and explains their relationships clearly. The general formula UIA = UIB - IPmt is given, which is exactly what the student needs to apply. The response also references the deferment period and repayment schedule consistent with the approved examples, reinforcing the financial principles involved.\n\nThe example from Year 2 is helpful and relevant, demonstrating how the formula applies in a prior year, which aids student comprehension. The hint at the end encourages the student to analyze the table values themselves, promoting active learning.\n\nThe only minor point preventing a perfect score is that the response could have briefly reminded the student how IPmt relates to Ad (i.e., that the loan payment is split into interest and principal portions), but this is a small omission and does not violate any rules.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality, pedagogically sound response that respects the constraints and effectively guides the student without revealing the direct answer."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **Principal Payment (PPmt)** for Year 5, you need to understand how the annual **Loan Payment (Ad)** is distributed.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nWhen Horizon Tech enters the repayment phase, each **Loan Payment (Ad)** is used to cover two things:\n1.  The interest that has accumulated (the **Interest Payment** or **IPmt**).\n2.  The remaining amount of the payment then goes toward reducing the balance of the loan (the **Principal Payment** or **PPmt**).\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the fixed annual amount of $4,601.46 paid by the startup after the deferment period.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of the annual payment dedicated to covering interest. \n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** The portion of the annual payment that reduces the outstanding loan balance.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **PPmt**, you use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Example from Year 4\nWe can see this principle in action by looking at the values for Year 4:\n*   The **Loan Payment (Ad)** was **4,601.46**.\n*   The **Interest Payment (IPmt)** was **2,784.6**.\n*   By subtracting the **IPmt** from the **Ad** ($4,601.46 - 2,784.6$), we find that the **Principal Payment (PPmt)** for Year 4 was **1,816.86**.\n\n### Hint for Year 5\nTo find the **BLANK** value for Year 5:\n1.  Locate the **Loan Payment (Ad)** for Year 5 in the table.\n2.  Locate the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** for Year 5.\n3.  Subtract the **IPmt** from the **Ad** to determine how much of that year's payment was applied to the principal.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and effectively guides the student without providing the direct answer. It clearly explains the relationship between the loan payment, interest payment, and principal payment using the exact vocabulary from the scenario. The formula PPmt = Ad - IPmt is correctly provided, and the example from Year 4 demonstrates the calculation method without revealing the Year 5 solution. The hint encourages the student to use the table values to perform the calculation independently. The language is clear, concise, and matches the approved terminology. The only minor deduction is for a slight inconsistency in the example where the interest payment for Year 4 (2,784.6) seems unusually high compared to the loan payment (4,601.46), which might confuse the student, but this is likely due to the scenario data rather than the explanation itself. Overall, the response is very helpful and well-aligned with the instructions."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 5, you need to understand how the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is distributed.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nWhen Horizon Tech makes a **fixed annual payment (Ad)**, that payment is used to cover two things:\n1. The **IPmt (Interest Payment)**, which covers the interest that has accrued.\n2. The **PPmt (Principal Payment)**, which is the remaining portion of the payment that goes toward reducing the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **PPmt**, you can use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Definitions of Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** The fixed annual amount Horizon Tech pays each year after the deferment period ($2,918.26).\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of the annual payment dedicated to covering the interest.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** The portion of the annual payment that reduces the actual loan balance.\n\n### Example from Year 4\nTo see how this works, let\u2019s look at the row for Year 4:\n*   The **Ad (Loan Payment)** was **$2,918.26**.\n*   The **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for that year was **$691.93**.\n*   By subtracting the interest portion from the total payment ($2,918.26 - $691.93), we arrive at the **PPmt** of **$2,226.33**.\n\n### Hint for Year 5\nLook at the values provided in your table for Year 5. You already have the **Ad (Loan Payment)** of **$2,918.26** and the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** of **$536.09**. \n\nIf you subtract the amount allocated for interest from the total annual payment, you will find the amount that was applied as a **Principal Payment (PPmt)** for that year.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and the scenario context. It does not provide the direct answer for the PPmt in Year 5 but instead guides the student clearly on how to calculate it using the formula PPmt = Ad - IPmt. The explanation of the variables matches the vocabulary used in the problem and the loan table, and the example from Year 4 effectively demonstrates the method without revealing the Year 5 solution. The language is clear, concise, and appropriate for undergraduate financial engineering students. The response avoids any disallowed terminology and sticks strictly to the approved phrasing.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for a slight redundancy in mentioning \"Interest Payment\" twice in the first bullet point under \"General Financial Principle,\" which could be streamlined. Otherwise, this is an excellent, helpful, and rule-compliant response that encourages student understanding without giving away the answer."
