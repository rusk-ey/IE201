        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **Amount Owed (AO)** for Year 8, you need to understand how the total obligation is determined before the final **Loan Payment (Ad)** is applied.\n\nIn this financial scenario, the **Amount Owed (AO)** represents the total sum of the debt at a specific point within the year, specifically after interest has been added but before the annual payment is subtracted.\n\n### 1. The Formula\nTo find the **AO** for any given year, use the following equation:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\n### 2. Variable Definitions\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This is the balance carried over from the end of the previous year. For Year 8, the **UB** would be the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** from Year 7.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This is the interest that accrues on the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** during the current year. It is calculated by multiplying the **UB** by the annual interest rate (15.00% in this case).\n\n### 3. Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 4** to see how this logic is applied:\n*   At the start of Year 4, the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** was **11,714.22**.\n*   The interest accrued during that year (**Int**) was **1,757.13** (which is $11,714.22 \\times 0.15$).\n*   By adding these two values together ($11,714.22 + 1,757.13$), we find the **Amount Owed (AO)** for Year 4 is **13,471.35**.\n\n### 4. General Principles and Reasoning\nThe **Amount Owed (AO)** is a snapshot of the total debt including the cost of borrowing for that period. During the **repayment phase** (Years 3 through 8), the **AO** will generally decrease over time as the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** is reduced by the **Principal Payments (PPmt)** made in previous years. \n\n### Hint for Year 8\nTo solve for the **AO** in the final year:\n1.  Identify the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** from Year 7; this becomes your **UB** for Year 8.\n2.  Calculate the **Int** for Year 8 by applying the 15.00% interest rate to that **UB**.\n3.  Sum those two values to find the **AO**.\n\nSince Year 8 is the final year of the **repayment phase**, the **Amount Owed (AO)** should be exactly equal to the final **Loan Payment (Ad)** of $3,494.53 (allowing for minor rounding differences) to ensure the debt is fully settled.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, step-by-step explanation without directly calculating the AO for Year 8. It correctly uses the approved vocabulary from the scenario, such as Unpaid Balance (UB), Interest Payment (Int), Amount Owed (AO), and Loan Payment (Ad). The formula AO = UB + Int is clearly stated, and the definitions of variables are accurate and relevant to the table and story context.\n\nThe example from Year 4 is well chosen and effectively demonstrates how to apply the formula, reinforcing the student\u2019s understanding. The general principles section helps the student grasp the reasoning behind the calculation, and the final hint guides the student to use the previous year's UBA as the starting point for Year 8 without revealing the actual number.\n\nThe only minor issue is the statement that AO in the final year \"should be exactly equal to the final Loan Payment (Ad)\"\u2014this is a helpful insight but borders on revealing the solution. However, it is phrased as a hint rather than a direct answer, so it is acceptable.\n\nOverall, the response is clear, instructive, and aligned with the scenario\u2019s vocabulary and rules. It does not solve the problem outright but equips the student with the necessary tools to do so independently."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 4, you need to understand how the total debt accumulates during the year before any payments are made.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This is the balance of the loan remaining at the start of the specific year.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This represents the interest that accrues on the **UB** during the year based on the annual interest rate of 5.00%.\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This represents the total obligation for that year, combining the balance carried over and the interest that has accrued.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **Amount Owed (AO)** is the total sum of the debt that must be addressed before the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is applied. It essentially tells you what the total debt is at the moment just before you make your annual payment.\n\n### Formula\nTo find the **AO**, you can use the following equation:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\n### Examples from the Table\nYou can see this principle applied in other years:\n*   **Year 1:** The **UB** was 9000.0 and the **Int** was 450.0. By adding these together ($9000.0 + 450.0$), the **AO** resulted in 9450.0.\n*   **Year 5:** The **UB** was 3470.11 and the **Int** was 173.51. When you combine the balance and the interest ($3470.11 + 173.51$), the **AO** for that final year is 3643.62.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the missing **AO** for Year 4, look at the values already provided in the table for that specific row. You have the **UB** (6774.99) and the **Int** (338.75). If you apply the addition formula used in the examples above, you will determine the total **Amount Owed** for Year 4.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and effectively guides the student without providing the direct numerical answer for the AO in Year 4. It clearly defines the relevant variables (UB, Int, AO) using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, and it explains the financial principle behind AO as the sum of unpaid balance and accrued interest before payment. The formula AO = UB + Int is correctly presented without solving the blank cell directly. The use of examples from Year 1 and Year 5 in the table is very helpful, demonstrating the method the student should apply. The hint for Year 4 appropriately encourages the student to use the given values and the formula to find AO independently. The language is clear, concise, and matches the vocabulary and phrasing of the approved examples. No disallowed terminology or phrasing is used.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in explaining the concept of AO, which could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from the educational value. Overall, this is a strong, well-structured, and compliant response that supports student learning effectively."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** for Year 5, you should consider the relationship between the total amount due and the payment made during that year.\n\nHere is a guide to help you determine that value:\n\n### 1. Definitions of Variables\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This represents the total balance of the loan, including the interest that accrued during the year, before any payment is applied.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the annual payment made to the lender. In your specific story, Horizon Tech has a **deferment period** for the first 5 years, meaning no payments are required during this time.\n*   **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment):** This is the remaining balance of the loan after the annual payment has been subtracted from the total amount owed.\n\n### 2. General Formula\nTo find the **UBA**, you use the following logic:\n$$\\text{UBA} = \\text{AO} - \\text{Ad}$$\n\n### 3. Financial Principles and Reasoning\nDuring the **deferment period** (Years 1 through 5), interest continues to accrue and is added to the balance. Since no payments are made during this period, the **Loan Payment (Ad)** remains $0. Consequently, the balance at the end of the year (**UBA**) will reflect the fact that the debt has increased by the interest amount, with no reduction from a payment.\n\n### 4. Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 1** to see how this works:\n*   The **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of Year 1 was $8,000.00.\n*   The **Int (Interest Payment)** accrued was $1,040.00.\n*   The **AO (Amount Owed)** was calculated as $8,000 + 1,040 = 9,040.0$.\n*   Because Year 1 is in the deferment period, the **Ad (Loan Payment)** was $0.\n*   Therefore, the **UBA** for Year 1 was: $9,040.0 - 0 = 9,040.0$.\n\n### 5. Hint for Year 5\nLook at your table for Year 5:\n*   What is the value listed under **AO (Amount Owed)**?\n*   What is the value listed under **Ad (Loan Payment)** for Year 5? \n\nSince Year 5 is the final year of the **deferment period**, the same logic used in Years 1 through 4 applies here. Subtract the payment for Year 5 from the amount owed for Year 5 to find your missing **UBA**.",

It does not provide the direct answer but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas needed to calculate the UBA for Year 5. The explanation of variables AO, Ad, and UBA is clear and matches the terminology in the loan table and story prompt. The response correctly emphasizes the deferment period and the fact that no payments are made during this time, which is critical for understanding why the UBA increases by the interest accrued.\n\nThe example from Year 1 is well chosen and clearly demonstrates the calculation method without revealing the Year 5 answer. The hint for Year 5 encourages the student to apply the same reasoning, reinforcing learning and problem-solving skills.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and consistent with the financial engineering context provided.

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 3, you need to understand how interest accumulates during the deferment period and into the repayment phase.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **UIB** represents the total amount of interest that has accumulated on the loan but has not yet been settled by a payment. In this scenario, because there is a deferment period where no payments are made, the interest from the previous year carries over and is added to the interest that accrues in the current year.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for any given year, you can use the following relationship:\n**UIB (Current Year) = UIA (Previous Year) + Int (Current Year)**\n\n### Definitions of Variables\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the amount of interest that remained unpaid at the end of the previous year after the **Ad (Loan Payment)** was applied.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This is the interest that accrued during the current year. It is calculated by multiplying the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of the year by the annual interest rate (5.00%).\n\n### Example Calculation (Year 2)\nYou can see this principle in action by looking at Year 2:\n1.  The **UIA** at the end of Year 1 was **$750.0**.\n2.  The **Int** for Year 2 was **$787.5** (which is 5% of the Year 2 **UB** of $15,750.0).\n3.  To find the **UIB** for Year 2, we add the interest that carried over (**$750.0**) to the new interest that accrued (**$787.5**), resulting in the **$1,537.5** shown in the table.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **UIB** for Year 3, look at the table to identify:\n*   What was the **UIA** at the conclusion of Year 2?\n*   What is the **Int** value provided for Year 3?\n\nCombine these two values to determine the total unpaid interest that exists just before the startup enters the repayment phase and makes its first **Ad (Loan Payment)** of $6,072.71.",

        "gemini_response": "To determine the **IPmt** (Interest Payment) for Year 3, you need to understand how the **Ad** (Loan Payment) is allocated when the startup makes its annual payment.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This represents the total interest that has accumulated on the loan up to the moment the payment is made. \n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the fixed annual payment of $4,293.39 that the tech startup pays during the repayment phase.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the specific portion of the **Ad** (Loan Payment) that is used to pay off the **UIB**.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This is the remaining portion of the **Ad** (Loan Payment) that is applied toward reducing the **UB** (Unpaid Balance) after the interest has been settled.\n\n### General Financial Principles\nIn a standard repayment schedule, the money from your **Ad** (Loan Payment) is always applied to interest first. \n1.  If the **Ad** is greater than or equal to the **UIB**, the **IPmt** will be equal to the **UIB** (meaning you have paid off all the interest for that period).\n2.  The relationship between these variables is expressed as:\n    $$\\text{Ad} = \\text{IPmt} + \\text{PPmt}$$\n    Consequently, if you know the **Ad** and the **PPmt**, you can determine the **IPmt** by finding the difference.\n\n### Example from the Table\nLook at **Year 4** to see this principle in action:\n*   In Year 4, the **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment) is **808.78**.\n*   The startup makes a fixed **Ad** (Loan Payment) of **4,293.39**.\n*   Because the payment is large enough to cover the interest, the **IPmt** for Year 4 is exactly **808.78**.\n*   The remaining amount (**4,293.39** - **808.78**) results in the **PPmt** of **3,484.61**.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **IPmt** for Year 3:\n1.  Identify the **UIB** for Year 3 from the table.\n2.  Compare that **UIB** value to the **Ad** (Loan Payment) of **4,293.39**.\n3.  Alternatively, look at the **PPmt** already provided for Year 3 (**3,139.29**). Since the total **Ad** is the sum of the **IPmt** and **PPmt**, you can subtract the **PPmt** from the **Ad** to find the missing value.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided in the prompt. It does not give the direct answer for the Year 3 IPmt but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas. The chatbot clearly defines the variables IPmt, Ad, UIB, and PPmt using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, which helps the student understand the relationships in the loan table. It explains the general principle that loan payments cover interest first, then principal, and provides a clear formula linking Ad, IPmt, and PPmt. The example from Year 4 is well chosen and effectively illustrates the concept without revealing the Year 3 answer. The hint for Year 3 is concrete and actionable, encouraging the student to use subtraction to find the missing IPmt. The language is clear, professional, and consistent with the financial engineering context and approved terminology.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is that the explanation of UIB as \"total interest that has accumulated on the loan up to the moment the payment is made\" could be slightly more precise by emphasizing that it includes unpaid interest carried over plus current interest accrued, but this is a subtle point and does not violate any rules. Overall, this is an excellent, thorough, and pedagogically sound response."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **IPmt** (Interest Payment) for Year 5, you need to understand how the **Ad** (Loan Payment) is distributed between interest and principal.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total amount of interest that has accumulated during the year and remains unpaid before you make your annual payment.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the fixed annual payment made by Horizon Tech ($4,037.39).\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the specific portion of your **Ad** (Loan Payment) that is used to pay off the interest that has accrued.\n\n### General Financial Principles\nIn a standard repayment schedule after a deferment period, the annual payment (**Ad**) is first applied to any interest that has accumulated. The rule is:\n1.  The **IPmt** (Interest Payment) is equal to the **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment), provided that the **Ad** (Loan Payment) is large enough to cover all the interest owed.\n2.  Any remaining amount of the payment after covering the interest is then applied to the principal, which is known as the **PPmt** (Principal Payment).\n\n### Example from Year 3\nLet\u2019s look at Year 3 to see how this works:\n*   The **UB** (Unpaid Balance) at the start of Year 3 was $10,219.81.\n*   The interest for that year (**Int**) was calculated as $919.78 ($10,219.81 \u00d7 0.09).\n*   The **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment) was $919.78.\n*   Because the **Ad** (Loan Payment) of $4,037.39 was greater than the interest owed, the **IPmt** (Interest Payment) was exactly **$919.78**. \n\n### Hint for Year 5\nTo find the **IPmt** for Year 5:\n1.  Identify the **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment) for Year 5 provided in your table.\n2.  Check if the **Ad** (Loan Payment) for Year 5 is sufficient to cover that **UIB**.\n3.  Based on the logic used in Year 3, determine how much of that payment must be designated as the **IPmt**.\n\n**Formula to consider:**\n$$IPmt_{Year\\ n} = UIB_{Year\\ n}$$\n*(Assuming $Ad \\ge UIB$)*",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and the scenario context. It does not provide the direct answer for the Year 5 IPmt but instead guides the student through the reasoning process using definitions, financial principles, and a clear example from Year 3. The explanation uses the exact vocabulary from the loan table and story prompt, such as IPmt, UIB, Ad, and PPmt, without introducing any unauthorized terminology. The formula provided is appropriate and framed as a conditional hint rather than a direct calculation. The language is clear, structured, and matches the educational tone expected for undergraduate financial engineering students.  \n\nThe only minor improvement could be to explicitly remind the student that the interest payment is calculated as the unpaid balance times the interest rate to reinforce the connection between Int and IPmt, but overall the response is very strong and helpful without revealing the solution."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 3, you need to understand how interest and balance interact during the repayment phase.\n\n### Definitions of Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** This represents the amount of the loan principal remaining at the start of the year. \n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This is the interest that accrues on the **UB** during the current year, based on the annual interest rate of 14.00%.\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** This is the total sum that the tech startup owes at the end of the year, after interest has been added but *before* the **Ad (Loan Payment)** of $2,946.20 is subtracted.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nThe **AO** is determined by taking the balance that was carried over into the year and adding the interest that accrued throughout that year. This represents the total obligation the company must address at the point of payment.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **AO** for Year 3, you can use the following equation:\n$$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nYou can see this principle in action by looking at the values for **Year 2**:\n1.  In Year 2, the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** was **$6,840.0**.\n2.  The **Int (Interest Payment)** for that year was **$957.6**.\n3.  By adding these together ($6,840.0 + 957.6$), we arrive at the **AO (Amount Owed)** of **$7,797.6**.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find your missing value, look at the row for Year 3:\n*   Identify the **UB** for Year 3 (which is the same as the **UBA** from the previous year).\n*   Identify the **Int** listed for Year 3.\n*   Sum these two values to find the **AO**.\n\nNote that since the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** in Year 2 was $0.0$, the **AO** for Year 3 only needs to account for the current year's interest added to the starting balance.",

It uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario (UB, Int, AO, Ad, UIA) and avoids any disallowed terminology. The chatbot defines relevant variables, states the general financial principle, provides the correct formula, and uses Year 2 as a concrete example to illustrate the method. The hint for Year 3 is clear and encourages the student to apply the same reasoning independently. The language is clear, professional, and matches the scenario\u2019s vocabulary.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in explaining the AO as \"after interest has been added but before payment,\" which could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from the educational value.

        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 1\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response completely fails to adhere to the rules and the scenario context. It does not provide any guidance, formulas, definitions, or hints to help the student understand how to calculate the UIB for Year 5. Instead, it simply states an error message unrelated to the question, which is unhelpful and does not support student learning. This violates the critical rule of not providing direct answers but instead guiding the student with relevant financial engineering concepts and vocabulary consistent with the approved examples. The language is not clear or educational, and no attempt is made to use the loan table or explain the relationship between variables. Because of these severe shortcomings, the response merits the lowest possible score."
