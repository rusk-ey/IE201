        "gemini_response": "To provide the most accurate answer, it is helpful to know the specific subject (e.g., Accounting, Social Security, or Finance). However, in most academic contexts, **UBA** typically stands for **Unpaid Balance Amount** or **Unamortized Balance of an Asset**.\n\nHere is how you calculate it for **Year 1**:\n\n### 1. If UBA means Unpaid Balance (Leases/Loans)\nThis is the amount remaining on a loan or lease after the first year of payments.\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the **Initial Principal** (the starting balance).\n*   **Step 2:** Calculate the **Interest** for Year 1 (Initial Principal \u00d7 Interest Rate).\n*   **Step 3:** Subtract that interest from your **Total Year 1 Payment** to find the **Principal Reduction**.\n*   **Step 4:** Subtract the Principal Reduction from the Initial Principal.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\text{Year 1 UBA} = \\text{Initial Balance} - (\\text{Total Payment} - \\text{Interest Expense})$$\n\n---\n\n### 2. If UBA means Unamortized Balance (Fixed Assets)\nThis is the remaining value of an asset after the first year of depreciation.\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the **Cost of the Asset**.\n*   **Step 2:** Calculate the **Depreciation Expense** for Year 1.\n*   **Step 3:** Subtract the Year 1 depreciation from the Cost.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\text{Year 1 UBA} = \\text{Initial Cost} - \\text{Year 1 Depreciation}$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. If UBA means Unrounded Benefit Amount (Social Security Math)\nIn some financial planning courses, UBA refers to the raw benefit amount before rounding down to the nearest dime.\n*   **Step 1:** Take the **AIME** (Average Indexed Monthly Earnings).\n*   **Step 2:** Apply the three formula percentages (90%, 32%, and 15%) to the specific \"bend points\" for that year.\n*   **Step 3:** Sum those three results together without rounding.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Tip:**\nTo calculate any \"Year 1\" balance, always start with the **Initial Value** and subtract the **portion of the payment or cost** that actually reduced the balance during that first year.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 2\n\n- Feedback: The response does not adhere to the strict scenario context and approved phrasing rules. The scenario clearly involves a loan with deferment and repayment terms for a local startup, as indicated by the approved examples. The chatbot's answer introduces multiple unrelated definitions of \"UBA\" (Unpaid Balance Amount, Unamortized Balance of an Asset, Unrounded Benefit Amount) and covers topics outside the loan context, such as fixed asset depreciation and Social Security benefits. This is outside the approved vocabulary and scenario scope, violating the requirement to use only the provided phrasing and terminology. Additionally, the response provides formulas and explanations that do not align with the loan deferment and repayment structure described in the scenario. The language is not consistent with the vocabulary used in the approved examples, and the answer does not focus on helping the student understand the loan balance calculation after the deferment period without giving a direct answer. Overall, the response is off-topic, confusing, and does not meet the evaluation criteria."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the interest payment (**IPmt**) for Year 1, you can use the Excel function or a manual calculation. The IPmt represents the portion of a loan payment that goes toward interest rather than the principal.\n\n### 1. Using the Excel IPMT Function\nThe syntax is:\n`=IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv)`\n\n*   **rate:** The interest rate per period. (If the loan is monthly, divide the annual rate by 12).\n*   **per:** The specific period you want to find. (For the very first payment of Year 1, use **1**).\n*   **nper:** The total number of payment periods for the life of the loan.\n*   **pv:** The Present Value, or the total amount of the loan.\n\n**Example:**\nFor a \\$10,000 loan at 5% annual interest for 3 years, paid monthly:\n`=IPMT(0.05/12, 1, 36, -10000)`\n\n---\n\n### 2. Manual Calculation (Conceptual)\nFor the very first payment of Year 1, the calculation is straightforward because you haven't paid off any principal yet:\n\n**Interest = Beginning Balance \u00d7 Periodic Interest Rate**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Determine your periodic rate (Annual Rate \u00f7 Number of payments per year).\n*   **Step 2:** Multiply that rate by the total loan balance.\n\n*Example: If you owe \\$10,000 at a 1% monthly rate, your interest for Month 1 is \\$100 ($10,000 \\times 0.01$).*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Calculating Total Interest for the Whole of Year 1\nIf you need the **total interest paid for the entire first year** (all 12 months), use the **CUMIPMT** function:\n\n`=CUMIPMT(rate, nper, pv, start_period, end_period, type)`\n\n*   **start_period:** 1\n*   **end_period:** 12\n*   **type:** Usually 0 (payment at end of period)\n\n### Summary Tip\nRemember that in Year 1, your **IPmt** will be at its highest. As you pay down the principal over time, the interest portion of your payment decreases.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 2\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response provides a detailed explanation of how to calculate the interest payment (IPmt) using Excel functions and manual calculations, which is generally helpful. However, it fails to adhere to the strict vocabulary and scenario phrasing required by the prompt. The response introduces terminology and examples unrelated to the approved set, such as monthly payments, the CUMIPMT function, and general Excel syntax, none of which appear in the approved examples. The scenario context specifically involves a local startup loan with deferred payments and fixed annual payments, but the response discusses monthly payments and amortization concepts outside this scope. Additionally, the response provides explicit formulas and examples that go beyond guiding the student toward understanding without giving direct answers. Due to these significant deviations from the required phrasing and scenario framing, the response violates the rules and must be scored very low."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate your **UBA (Unit-Based Assessment)** for Year 6, you are essentially finding the average of your performance across different units of study. \n\nWhile specific school systems may have slight variations, the standard way to calculate it is as follows:\n\n### 1. Collect Your Scores\nGather all the marks or percentages you received for each individual unit or test completed during the Year 6 term or year.\n\n### 2. Add the Scores Together\nAdd up all of those individual scores to get a **Total Score**.\n*   *Example:* If you had three units with scores of 70, 80, and 90, your Total Score is **240**.\n\n### 3. Divide by the Number of Units\nDivide your Total Score by the number of units you included in your sum.\n*   *Formula:* **Total Score \u00f7 Number of Units = UBA**\n*   *Example:* 240 \u00f7 3 = **80**. Your UBA would be 80.\n\n---\n\n### If your units have different \"Weights\":\nSometimes, a final exam is worth more than a small class test. In this case, you use a **Weighted Average**:\n1.  Multiply each score by its \"weight\" (percentage of the total grade).\n2.  Add those results together.\n*   *Example:* If Unit A (50% of grade) is 80 and Unit B (50% of grade) is 90:\n    *   (80 \u00d7 0.5) + (90 \u00d7 0.5) = 40 + 45 = **85**.\n\n### Summary Tip\nIf you are calculating this for a specific school report and your scores are given as levels (like \"Working Towards\" or \"Exceeding\"), check with your teacher to see what **numerical value** they assign to each level before doing your math!",

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unearned Interest Benefit or Unearned Insurance Benefit)** for Year 1, you essentially need to determine how much of a total upfront payment has **not** yet been \"used up\" or \"earned\" by the end of the first year.\n\nWhile the exact formula can vary slightly depending on your specific textbook or simulation (e.g., if you are using the straight-line method or the Rule of 78s), the most common approach is the **Straight-Line Method**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Identify the Key Figures\n*   **Total Amount:** The total interest or insurance premium paid/received upfront.\n*   **Total Term:** The total duration of the policy or loan (usually in months).\n*   **Months Used:** How many months of the policy/loan occurred during Year 1.\n\n### 2.
