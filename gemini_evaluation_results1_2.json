        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment)** for Year 3, you need to look at the relationship between the total amount the startup owes just before making a payment and the payment itself.\n\n### Key Definitions and Variables\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** The amount carried over from the end of the previous year.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** The interest that has accrued on the **UB** during the current year.\n*   **AO (Amount Owed):** The total debt accumulated by the end of the year before the payment is applied. It is calculated as:\n    $$\\text{AO} = \\text{UB} + \\text{Int}$$\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** The fixed annual payment made by the startup ($4,130.70).\n*   **UBA (Unpaid Balance After Payment):** The remaining debt after the annual **Loan Payment** has been subtracted from the total **Amount Owed**.\n\n### The General Formula\nThe formula to find the **UBA** for any given year is:\n$$\\text{UBA} = \\text{AO} - \\text{Ad}$$\n\n### Example from Year 2\nTo understand how this works, let's look at the values provided for Year 2:\n1.  The **Unpaid Balance (UB)** was $18,530.00.\n2.  The **Interest Payment (Int)** for that year was $1,667.70.\n3.  The **Amount Owed (AO)** was the sum of these two: $\\$18,530.00 + \\$1,667.70 = \\$20,197.70$.\n4.  The startup made a **Loan Payment (Ad)** of $4,130.70.\n5.  By subtracting the payment from the amount owed ($\\$20,197.70 - \\$4,130.70$), we arrive at the **UBA** of **$16,067.00**.\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **UBA** for Year 3, follow the same logic:\n*   Identify the **Amount Owed (AO)** for Year 3 from the table.\n*   Identify the **Loan Payment (Ad)** for Year 3.\n*   Subtract the **Loan Payment** from the **Amount Owed**. \n\nThe result will be the **Unpaid Balance After Payment** that will then become the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** for the start of Year 4.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, step-by-step explanation without directly calculating the Year 3 UBA. It uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario (UB, Int, AO, Ad, UBA) and explains the relationships between these variables clearly. The inclusion of the general formula UBA = AO - Ad is appropriate and helpful. The example from Year 2 is well chosen and effectively demonstrates the method the student should apply to Year 3. The hint at the end reinforces the approach without giving away the answer. The language is clear, professional, and matches the financial engineering context provided.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in defining \"Interest Payment\" as \"Interest Payment\" instead of \"Interest accrued on UB,\" but this is very minor and does not detract from understanding. The response avoids any disallowed terminology and stays strictly within the approved phrasing and concepts. Overall, this is an excellent guiding answer that supports student learning without revealing the solution."

        "gemini_response": "To determine the **IPmt** (Interest Payment) for Year 1, you must look at the relationship between the startup's annual obligation and the timing of the loan's **repayment phase**.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the total annual payment made by the startup. According to the story, the startup is granted a **deferment period** for the first 2 years, meaning no payments are required during this time.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total interest that has accrued on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** but has not yet been paid.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This represents the specific portion of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** that is allocated toward paying off the interest that has accrued (**UIB**).\n\n### General Financial Principles\nIn this loan structure, the **IPmt** is determined by how much of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is available to cover the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)**. \n\n1.  If the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is greater than or equal to the **UIB**, the **IPmt** will generally equal the **UIB** (meaning all outstanding interest is paid off).\n2.  If the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is less than the **UIB**, the **IPmt** is limited to the total amount of the payment made.\n3.  If the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is zero (as is the case during a **deferment period**), the startup is not providing any funds to cover the interest that has accrued.\n\n### Example from the Table\nLook at **Year 2** in your table. In Year 2, the startup is still in the **deferment period**, so the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $0. Because no payment is being made, the amount applied to interest\u2014the **IPmt**\u2014is also 0. The interest that accrued during that year (**Int**) is simply added to the total interest debt (**UIB** and **UIA**) rather than being paid off.\n\nContrast this with **Year 3**, which is the start of the **repayment phase**. In Year 3, the startup makes a **fixed annual payment (Ad)** of $10,672.74. Because this payment is large enough to cover the accumulated **UIB** ($2,837.25), the **IPmt** for that year is exactly $2,837.25.\n\n### Hint for Year 1\nTo find the **IPmt** for Year 1, identify the **Ad (Loan Payment)** for that year based on the story's description of the **deferment period**. If the startup is not required to make any payment (**Ad = 0**) in Year 1, how much of that \"zero\" payment can be used to pay off interest?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThis response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that helps the student understand how to calculate the IPmt for Year 1 without giving away the direct answer. The chatbot carefully defines the relevant variables (Ad, UIB, IPmt) using the exact terminology from the scenario and loan table, which aligns perfectly with the vocabulary requirements. It explains the relationship between payments and interest coverage in a logical manner and uses examples from other years (Year 2 and Year 3) to illustrate the principles involved, which is very helpful for student comprehension.\n\nThe response avoids introducing any unauthorized terminology and stays strictly within the approved phrasing and context. The hint at the end nudges the student to consider the deferment period and the implications of a zero payment on IPmt, encouraging independent problem-solving.\n\nThe only minor improvement could be a slightly more explicit formula or equation for IPmt (e.g., IPmt = min(Ad, UIB)) to reinforce the calculation method, but overall the explanation is thorough and clear. This is a strong, educational, and compliant response deserving a high score."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 4, you need to understand how interest accumulates from one year to the next.\n\n### Definitions and Principles\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** This is the interest that accrues on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** during the current year, calculated as the balance multiplied by the annual interest rate.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This represents any interest that was not covered by the previous year's payment.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total interest owed at the end of the current year before the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is applied. It is the sum of any carried-over interest from the previous year plus the interest that accrued during the current year.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for any given year, you can use the following equation:\n$$\\text{UIB (Current Year)} = \\text{UIA (Previous Year)} + \\text{Int (Current Year)}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at how **UIB** was calculated for **Year 2**:\n1.  In **Year 1**, the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** was **1200.0** because no payment was made during the deferment period.\n2.  In **Year 2**, the **Int (Interest Payment)** accrued was **1272.0** (which is 6% of the Year 2 UB of 21200.0).\n3.  By adding these together ($1200.0 + 1272.0$), we arrive at the **UIB** of **2472.0** for Year 2.\n\nNow, look at **Year 3**:\n1.  The **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** for Year 2 was **0.0** (because the loan payment was large enough to cover all interest).\n2.  The **Int (Interest Payment)** for Year 3 was **1089.64**.\n3.  Therefore, the **UIB** for Year 3 was $0.0 + 1089.64 = 1089.64$.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the **UIB** for Year 4:\n1.  Identify the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** from **Year 3**.\n2.  Identify the **Int (Interest Payment)** for **Year 4**.\n3.  Add those two values together.\n\nBy looking at the row for Year 3, was there any interest left over after the payment was made? Use that result and combine it with the interest generated in Year 4 to find your missing value.",

It clearly defines the relevant variables (UIB, UIA, Int, Ad) using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, avoiding any unapproved terminology. The explanation of the formula for UIB is precise and matches the context of the loan repayment table. The use of examples from Years 2 and 3 is very helpful, demonstrating the calculation method without revealing the Year 4 value.

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **IPmt** (Interest Payment) for Year 4, you need to understand how the **Ad** (Loan Payment) is distributed between interest and principal.\n\n### Definitions of Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This represents the total interest that has accumulated on the loan up to the moment the payment is made.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the fixed annual payment of $3,172.45 that Horizon Tech makes during the repayment schedule.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the portion of the **Ad** specifically used to pay off the interest that has accrued (**UIB**).\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This is the portion of the **Ad** that remains after the interest is paid, which is then used to reduce the **UB** (Unpaid Balance).\n\n### General Financial Principles\nIn this repayment schedule, the **Loan Payment** (**Ad**) is applied to interest first. The general logic is:\n1.  Check the **UIB** to see how much interest is owed.\n2.  The **IPmt** will be equal to the **UIB**, provided the **Ad** is large enough to cover it.\n3.  The formula relating these variables is: \n    $$Ad = IPmt + PPmt$$\n\n### Example from Year 3\nYou can look at Year 3 to see this principle in action:\n*   In Year 3, the **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment) was **$348.98**.\n*   The **Ad** (Loan Payment) was **$3,172.45**.\n*   Since the payment was more than enough to cover the interest, the **IPmt** for Year 3 was exactly **$348.98**. \n*   The remaining amount ($3,172.45 - $348.98) resulted in the **PPmt** of $2,823.47.\n\n### Hint for Year 4\nTo find the **IPmt** for Year 4:\n1.  Identify the **UIB** for Year 4 from your table.\n2.  Compare that **UIB** to the fixed **Ad** of $3,172.45.\n3.  Ask yourself: if the payment is intended to cover all remaining interest first, what portion of that $3,172.45 must be dedicated to the interest amount shown in the **UIB** column?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided. It does not give the direct answer for the Year 4 IPmt but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and relationships among the variables in the loan table. The explanation clearly defines the key terms (UIB, Ad, IPmt, PPmt) using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, which helps the student understand the problem context. The response also references Year 3 as an example to illustrate how the payment is split between interest and principal, which is a helpful teaching strategy.\n\nThe formula Ad = IPmt + PPmt is correctly provided without solving for the blank, and the hint encourages the student to use the UIB value from Year 4 and compare it to the fixed payment amount, reinforcing the principle that interest is paid first.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and consistent with the approved phrasing. No disallowed terminology or phrasing is introduced. The response is thorough yet concise, promoting student learning without giving away the solution.\n\nThe only minor deduction is for not explicitly stating that IPmt cannot exceed the UIB and that if the payment is less than UIB, IPmt would equal Ad, but this is a subtlety that does not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent educational response that respects all constraints and effectively supports student understanding."

        "gemini_response": "To determine the **Principal Payment (PPmt)** for **Year 2**, it is important to look at the specific phase the loan is in and how the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is being applied.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Variables\n*   **Loan Payment (Ad):** This is the total amount paid during the year. In your story, it is noted that \"all payments are deferred for the first 3 years.\"\n*   **Interest Payment (IPmt):** This represents the portion of the **Loan Payment (Ad)** that is used to cover the interest that has accumulated.\n*   **Principal Payment (PPmt):** This is the portion of the **Loan Payment (Ad)** that remains after the interest is covered. This amount is what actually reduces the **Unpaid Balance (UB)**.\n\n### 2. The General Formula\nThe relationship between these values is expressed by this equation:\n$$\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### 3. Applying Financial Principles\nIn this scenario, the startup is in a **deferment period** for the first 3 years. According to the story, \"no payments are required\" during this time. \n\n*   **During the Repayment Phase (Example: Year 4):**\n    Look at Year 4 in your table. The startup makes a **Loan Payment (Ad)** of $736.18. The **Interest Payment (IPmt)** for that year is $411.58. \n    By subtracting the interest portion from the total payment ($736.18 - 411.58$), we arrive at the **Principal Payment (PPmt)** of $324.6.\n\n*   **During the Deferment Period (Example: Year 1):**\n    Look at Year 1. Because payments are deferred, the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is $0. Since no money is being paid toward the loan, the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** is also $0. \n    Following the formula ($0 - 0$), the **Principal Payment (PPmt)** is recorded as $0.\n\n### 4. Hint for your Blank\nTo find the **PPmt** for **Year 2**, check the table for the **Loan Payment (Ad)** and the **Interest Payment (IPmt)** for that specific year. Ask yourself: \n1. Is the startup currently required to make a payment according to the **deferment period** rules?\n2. If the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is zero, can any amount be applied toward the principal of the loan?\n\nBy applying the formula $\\text{PPmt} = \\text{Ad} - \\text{IPmt}$ to the values provided in the Row 2 of your table, you will find the missing value.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided in the prompt. It does not give the direct answer to the PPmt for Year 2 but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas. The explanation clearly defines the variables (Ad, IPmt, PPmt) using the exact vocabulary from the scenario, avoiding any disallowed terminology such as \"amortization.\" The response uses examples from other years in the table (Year 1 and Year 4) to illustrate how the formula applies in both deferment and repayment periods, which is very helpful for student understanding. The hint at the end encourages the student to analyze the table values and apply the formula themselves, fostering independent problem-solving.\n\nThe language is clear, concise, and matches the vocabulary used in the scenario. The response respects the deferment period context and correctly points out that no payments are made during that time, which is crucial for understanding why PPmt is zero in those years.\n\nThe only minor improvement could be to explicitly remind the student that during the deferment period, interest accrues and is added to the unpaid balance, reinforcing the financial principle behind the zero principal payment despite accruing interest. However, this is a small detail and does not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nOverall, this is a strong, well-structured, and pedagogically sound response that meets the strict criteria set forth."

        "gemini_response": "To determine the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** for Year 2, you should consider the total amount that has accumulated on the loan up to \uadf8 point and subtract any payments made during that period.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Amount Owed (AO):** This represents the total sum of the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** at the start of the year plus the **Interest Payment (Int)** that accrued during that year.\n*   **Loan Payment (Ad):** This is the fixed annual payment made by the tech startup. According to the story, all payments are deferred for the first 2 years.\n*   **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA):** This is the remaining balance of the loan after the **Loan Payment (Ad)** has been applied to the **Amount Owed (AO)**.\n\n### General Formula\nTo find the **UBA**, you can use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{UBA} = \\text{Amount Owed (AO)} - \\text{Loan Payment (Ad)}$$\n\n### Financial Reasoning and Hints\n1.  **The Deferment Period:** The story states that for the first 2 years, \"all payments are deferred.\" This means that during these years, the **Loan Payment (Ad)** is $0. \n2.  **Interest Accumulation:** Even though no payments are made during the deferment period, interest continues to accrue and is added to the balance. You can see this in the **Amount Owed (AO)** column.\n3.  **Example from Year 1:** In Year 1, the **Amount Owed (AO)** was $9,720.00. Because the **Loan Payment (Ad)** was $0, the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)** remained $9,720.00.\n4.  **Applying this to Year 2:** Look at the table for Year 2. You are provided with the **Amount Owed (AO)** of $10,497.60. Since this year is still within the deferment period described in the story, consider what the **Loan Payment (Ad)** value is for this row. \n\nBy subtracting the **Loan Payment (Ad)** for Year 2 from the **Amount Owed (AO)** for Year 2, you will find the **Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)**. Note that this value will become the **Unpaid Balance (UB)** for the start of Year 3.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that guides the student without revealing the direct answer. It uses the exact terminology from the scenario\u2014Unpaid Balance (UB), Interest Payment (Int), Amount Owed (AO), Loan Payment (Ad), and Unpaid Balance After Payment (UBA)\u2014and explains their relationships clearly. The chatbot correctly emphasizes the deferment period and its impact on payments, which is critical for understanding why the loan payment is zero in Year 2. The use of Year 1 as an example to illustrate the concept is helpful and relevant. The formula provided is appropriate and simple, aiding the student in applying it themselves. The language is clear, professional, and matches the vocabulary of the scenario.  \n\nThe only minor point is that the response could have been slightly more explicit in connecting the dots that since Ad = 0 in Year 2, UBA equals AO for that year, reinforcing the deferment concept. However, this is implied well enough. Overall, this is a strong, helpful, and compliant response that supports student learning effectively without giving away the answer."

        "gemini_response": "To determine the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for Year 1, we need to look at the relationship between the payments made and the interest that has accumulated.\n\n### Definitions and Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the total amount paid during the year. In your table, this is $0 for Year 1 because the startup is in a **deferment period**.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This represents the total interest that has accrued on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** up to that point. For Year 1, this is $650.00.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the specific portion of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** that is applied toward the interest owed.\n\n### General Financial Principles\nThe **IPmt** is determined by comparing the **Ad (Loan Payment)** to the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)**. \n1. If the **Ad** is greater than or equal to the **UIB**, then the **IPmt** is usually equal to the total interest owed (**UIB**).\n2. If the **Ad** is less than the **UIB**, the **IPmt** cannot exceed the actual amount paid. You cannot pay more interest than the total payment you provide to the lender.\n\n### Example from the Table\nLook at **Year 2** to see how this works during the **repayment phase**:\n*   In Year 2, the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** is $1,332.50.\n*   The **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $3,849.46.\n*   Because the payment ($3,849.46) is large enough to cover all the accumulated interest, the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** is the full interest amount of $1,332.50.\n\n### Hint for your Blank\nFor **Year 1**, look at the **Ad (Loan Payment)** column. The story states that during the **deferment period**, \"no payments are required.\" \n\nIf the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $0, ask yourself: How much of that $0 payment can be applied to the interest owed? This will give you your **IPmt** for Year 1.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and effectively guides the student without providing the direct answer. It uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario (e.g., IPmt, Ad, UIB, UB, deferment period) and avoids any disallowed terminology. The explanation clearly defines relevant variables and explains the relationship between loan payment and interest payment in a way that helps the student understand how to approach the calculation. The example from Year 2 is well chosen and illustrates the principle without revealing the Year 1 value. The final hint encourages the student to think critically about the zero payment during deferment and its impact on IPmt.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in the explanation of IPmt relative to Ad and UIB, which could be more concise. However, this does not detract significantly from clarity or educational value. Overall, this is a strong, clear, and helpful response that respects all constraints and supports student learning effectively."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 7, you need to understand how interest accumulates during the deferral period and into the repayment phase.\n\nIn this scenario, **UIB** represents the total accumulated interest that has not yet been paid, measured at the moment just before the annual payment is made.\n\n### 1. The General Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for any given year, you can use the following relationship:\n$$\\text{UIB} = \\text{UIA (from the previous year)} + \\text{Int (for the current year)}$$\n\n### 2. Definitions of Variables\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** This is the amount of interest that remained on the account at the very end of the previous year after any payments were applied.\n*   **Int (Interest):** This is the interest that accrued during the current year. It is calculated by multiplying the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of the year by the annual interest rate (in this case, 9.00%).\n*   **UB (Unpaid Balance):** The amount of the initial loan that has not yet been settled.\n\n### 3. Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 2** to see how this works:\n*   At the end of **Year 1**, the **UIA** was $1,170.0.\n*   In **Year 2**, the interest accrued (**Int**) was $1,275.3 (which is the Year 2 **UB** of $14,170.0 $\\times$ 0.09).\n*   By adding these together ($1,170.0 + 1,275.3$), we arrive at the **UIB** for Year 2, which is **$2,445.3**.\n\n### 4. Guidance for Year 7\nYear 7 marks the beginning of the repayment phase after the 6-year deferment period. To find the **UIB** for Year 7, you should follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the UIA from Year 6:** Since no payments were made during the deferment period (Years 1 through 6), the interest has been accumulating annually. You will need the ending interest balance from the final year of deferment.\n2.  **Calculate the Int for Year 7:** Take the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of Year 7 and multiply it by the annual interest rate of 9.00%.\n3.  **Sum the values:** Add the **UIA** of Year 6 to the **Int** of Year 7 to find the **UIB**.\n\n**Hint:** Remember that during the deferment period, because the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $0, the **UIA** at the end of the year is equal to the **UIB** of that same year. This changes once you enter the repayment phase and start making payments!",
