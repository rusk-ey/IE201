        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** for Year 7, you need to understand how the loan payment is applied to the interest that has accumulated.\n\nHere is a guide to the concepts and formulas you will need to find that value.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Vocabulary\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total amount of interest owed at the moment just before you make your annual payment. It includes interest carried over from previous years plus the new **Int (Interest Payment)** generated in the current year.\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** The fixed annual amount paid toward the debt ($3,830.12).\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of your annual payment (`Ad`) that specifically goes toward paying off interest.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** The amount of interest that remains unpaid after your annual payment has been applied.\n\n### 2. The General Formula\nTo find the **UIA**, you look at the interest balance before the payment and subtract the amount of interest you actually paid during that period:\n\n$$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Logic\nTo get to the Year 7 **UIA**, you must follow the flow of the table:\n\n1.  **Calculate the UIB for Year 7:** This is usually the **UIA** from Year 6 plus the new **Int** (interest) calculated on the **UB** (Unpaid Balance) at the start of Year 7.\n2.  **Determine the IPmt for Year 7:** In this loan structure, the annual payment (**Ad**) is applied to interest first. \n    *   If the payment (**Ad**) is *less* than the interest owed (**UIB**), then the entire payment goes to interest (**IPmt = Ad**).\n    *   If the payment (**Ad**) is *greater* than the interest owed (**UIB**), then you pay off all the interest (**IPmt = UIB**), and the remainder of your payment goes toward the principal (**PPmt**).\n3.  **Subtract:** Once you know how much interest was covered by the payment (**IPmt**), subtract that from the **UIB** to find the remaining **UIA**.\n\n### 4. Example from the Table (Year 5)\nLet\u2019s look at Year 5 to see this principle in action:\n*   **UIB (Year 5):** $5,056.80\n*   **Ad (Year 5):** $3,830.12\n*   **Logic:** Since the payment ($3,830.12) is less than the total interest owed ($5,056.80), the entire payment is used for interest. Therefore, **IPmt** = $3,830.12.\n*   **Calculation:** \n    $$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n    $$\\text{UIA} = 5,056.80 - 3,830.12 = 1,226.68$$\n    *(This matches the value in your table for Year 5).*\n\n### Hint for Year 7:\nBy Year 7, the **UIB** (Unpaid Interest Before Payment) will have decreased significantly because you have been chipping away at it in Years 5 and 6. \n\nIf your annual payment (**Ad**) of $3,830.12 is larger than the interest owed (**UIB**) in Year 7, it means you have enough money to pay off **all** the remaining interest. Ask yourself: if you pay off all the interest owed in the final year, what should the \"Unpaid Interest After Payment\" (**UIA**) logically be?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules provided in the chatbot's prompt. It does not provide a direct numerical answer for the UIA in Year 7 but instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas clearly and precisely. The explanation uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario\u2014UIB, UIA, IPmt, Ad, Int\u2014without introducing any unauthorized terminology. The step-by-step logic is well structured and helps the student understand how to approach the calculation. The example from Year 5 is particularly effective in demonstrating the method without giving away the final answer for Year 7. The hint at the end encourages critical thinking about the relationship between payment and interest owed, reinforcing understanding without revealing the solution.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and matches the educational context. The only minor deduction is for slight redundancy in defining IPmt twice (once in vocabulary and again in step 2), but this does not significantly detract from the overall quality. Overall, this is an excellent, instructive, and appropriately scaffolded response that respects the rules and supports student learning effectively."

The General Logic\nThe **UIA** is calculated based on whether the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is large enough to cover the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)**.\n\n*   **If the payment (Ad) is greater than or equal to the interest owed (UIB):** The interest is completely paid off. In this case, **UIA** becomes 0.0, and the remaining portion of the payment goes toward reducing the principal (**PPmt**).\n*   **If the payment (Ad) is less than the interest owed (UIB):** The payment only covers part of the interest. The formula would be:\n    $$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{Ad}$$\n\n### 3. Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 1** versus **Year 2** to see how this works:\n\n*   **Year 1 (Deferral Period):** Elena\u2019s **UIB** was $700.00, but her payment (**Ad**) was $0. Because the payment didn't cover any interest, the **UIA** remained $700.00.\n*   **Year 2 (Repayment Begins):** Elena\u2019s **UIB** was $1,449.00 (the $700 from Year 1 + $749 new interest). Her payment (**Ad**) was $2,609.63. Since $2,609.63 is much larger than $1,449.00, the interest was fully cleared, resulting in a **UIA** of $0.0.\n\n### 4. Steps for Year 6\nTo find the **UIA** for Year 6, ask yourself:\n1.  What is the **UIB** for Year 6? (This will be the **Int** for Year 6 plus any **UIA** carried over from Year 5).\n2.  Is Elena's annual payment of $2,609.63 (**Ad**) enough to cover that **UIB**?\n3.  Looking at the trend in Years 3, 4, and 5, has the payment been sufficient to cover the interest?\n\nIf the payment exceeds the interest owed, your **UIA** will reflect that the interest has been fully satisfied for that period.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and effectively guides the student without giving away the direct answer. It uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario and loan table, such as UIA, UIB, Ad, Int, and PPmt, maintaining consistency with the approved terminology. The explanation clearly defines the relevant variables and outlines the logic behind calculating UIA, emphasizing the relationship between the payment and unpaid interest before payment. The use of examples from Year 1 and Year 2 in the table is helpful and relevant, demonstrating how the concept applies in practice without revealing the Year 6 value. The step-by-step questions for Year 6 encourage the student to think critically and apply the pattern observed in previous years.\n\nThe only minor improvement could be a slightly clearer reminder that UIA is the leftover interest after the payment is applied, reinforcing the financial principle without stepping into full calculation. However, this is a subtle point and does not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nOverall, the response is clear, instructive, and well-aligned with the educational goals and constraints, justifying a high score."

It combines the principal you haven't paid back yet (UB) with the cost of borrowing that money for that specific year (Int). Once you have this total, you then apply the annual payment (**Ad**) to see what is left over for the next year.\n\n### Example from Year 4\nLet's look at how the **AO** was determined for Year 4 to see this principle in action:\n1.  In Year 4, the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** was **902.1**.\n2.  The **Int (Interest Payment)** for that year was **117.27**.\n3.  By adding these together ($902.1 + 117.27$), we arrived at the **AO** of **1019.37**.\n\n### Hint for Year 5\nTo find the **AO** for Year 5, look at the values already provided in the Year 5 row of your table:\n*   What is the **UB** listed for Year 5?\n*   What is the **Int** listed for Year 5?\n\nIf you add those two specific values together, you will find the total **Amount Owed** before Alex makes the final payment of $540.80.",

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for Year 2, it is important to understand the relationship between the total payment being made and the status of the loan during that specific year.\n\n### 1. Definition of Variables\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the total amount Elena pays to the lender in a given year.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This represents the portion of the **Ad (Loan Payment)** that is specifically used to cover accrued interest.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This is the total interest that has accumulated up to that point but has not yet been paid.\n*   **Deferral Period:** A specific timeframe (Years 1 through 3 in this scenario) where \"no payments are required.\"\n\n### 2. General Financial Principle\nIn a loan schedule, the **IPmt** is derived from the **Ad (Loan Payment)**. If a borrower makes a payment, the money is typically applied to the interest owed first. However, if the borrower is in a deferral period and the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is zero, there are no funds available to apply toward the interest.\n\n### 3. Reasoning and Logic\nTo determine the **IPmt** for Year 2, look at the \"Scenario Context\" provided:\n*   During the 3-year deferral period, the prompt states that \"**no payments are required**, though interest continues to accrue.\"\n*   If Elena is not making a **Loan Payment (Ad)** during this year, how much can she contribute toward the **Interest Payment (IPmt)**?\n\n### 4. Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 1** for comparison:\n*   In Year 1, the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** is 480.0. \n*   However, the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is 0 because it is the first year of the deferral period.\n*   As a result, the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for Year 1 is 0. \n\nYou can apply this same logic to Year 2. Ask yourself: Is Elena making a cash payment (**Ad**) in Year 2? If not, what does that mean for the amount of interest she is \"paying\" off in that specific row?\n\n### 5. Hint for Calculation\nThe formula for **IPmt** when a payment is made is usually the lesser of the **UIB** or the **Ad**. If **Ad** is 0, what must **IPmt** be?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (8/10)\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and provides a clear, structured explanation that helps the student understand how to approach calculating the IPmt for Year 2 without giving away the direct answer. It correctly uses the vocabulary from the scenario (e.g., Ad, IPmt, UIB, deferral period) and references the loan table to illustrate the concept. The explanation emphasizes the deferral period and the fact that no payments are made, guiding the student to conclude that IPmt must be zero when Ad is zero.\n\nThe response could be improved by explicitly stating the formula for IPmt in the repayment phase (IPmt = interest accrued on the unpaid balance or the portion of Ad applied to interest) without solving the blank. Also, the phrase \"the formula for IPmt when a payment is made is usually the lesser of the UIB or the Ad\" is somewhat imprecise and could be clarified to better fit the scenario\u2019s terminology and loan structure. A brief mention that during deferral, interest accrues but is unpaid, so IPmt is zero, would reinforce understanding.\n\nOverall, the response is helpful, clear, and aligned with the scenario\u2019s vocabulary and rules, but it could include a slightly stronger emphasis on the formula and the relationship between unpaid interest and payments to maximize student learning."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 4, you need to understand how Elena's total annual payment is divided.\n\nIn financial engineering and loan amortization, every payment made towards a loan is generally split into two parts: one part covers the interest that has accumulated, and the remaining part goes toward reducing the actual balance of the loan.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** This is the total amount Elena pays to the lender in a given year.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** This is the portion of the current payment dedicated to covering the interest that has accrued. In Year 4, this value is specifically high because it covers the interest that built up during the three-year deferral period.\n*   **PPmt (Principal Payment):** This is the portion of the payment that effectively reduces the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n\n### 2. The General Formula\nThe relationship between these three variables is straightforward. The total payment is the sum of its interest and principal components:\n\n$$Ad = IPmt + PPmt$$\n\nTo find the **PPmt**, you can rearrange the formula:\n\n$$PPmt = Ad - IPmt$$\n\n### 3. Example from Year 5\nYou can see this principle in action by looking at the data for Year 5 in your table:\n*   In Year 5, the **Ad (Loan Payment)** is $766.91$.\n*   The **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for that year is $69.72$.\n*   By subtracting the interest portion from the total payment ($766.91 - 69.72$), we arrive at the **PPmt** of $697.19$.\n\n### 4. Hint for Year 4\nTo find the **PPmt** for Year 4, look at the values provided in that specific row:\n1.  Identify the **Ad (Loan Payment)** Elena makes in Year 4.\n2.  Identify the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** calculated for Year 4 (which, in this case, matches the **UIB** because Elena is paying off all interest accrued during the deferral period first).\n3.  Subtract the **IPmt** from the **Ad**. \n\nThe result will be the amount of money left over from her payment to be applied directly to the principal balance!",

It does not give the direct answer for the PPmt in Year 4 but instead guides the student clearly through the conceptual understanding and the formula needed to find it. The explanation uses the exact vocabulary from the scenario\u2014such as Ad, IPmt, PPmt, and UB\u2014and avoids introducing any unapproved terminology like \"amortization.\" The response includes a relevant formula, a clear definition of variables, and a concrete example from Year 5 to illustrate the method, which is very helpful for student learning. The hint for Year 4 is appropriately framed to encourage the student to apply the formula themselves without revealing the solution. The language is clear, professional, and matches the financial engineering context.  \n\nThe only minor deduction is because the phrase \"financial engineering and loan amortization\" introduces the term \"amortization,\" which is not in the approved vocabulary list. This is a slight deviation from the strict terminology rule. Removing or replacing \"loan amortization\" with a phrase consistent with the approved examples would make the response perfect.  \n\nOverall, this is a strong, well-structured, and educational response that supports student understanding without giving away the answer."
