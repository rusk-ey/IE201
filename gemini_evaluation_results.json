        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** for Year 2, you need to look at how interest accumulates over time, especially during the deferral period.\n\n### Definition of Variables\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** This represents the total amount of interest that has accrued on the loan but has not yet been paid off at the time the current year's payment is due.\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** The interest generated during the current year, calculated based on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)** at the start of that year.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** The interest that remains from the previous year after any payments (Ad) were applied.\n\n### General Financial Principle\nDuring a deferral period, Elena is not making any payments (**Ad = 0**). Because no interest is being paid off, the interest from previous years carries over and \"piles up.\" The **UIB** is the sum of the interest that just accrued this year plus any interest that was left over from the end of the previous year.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **UIB** for any given year, you can use this equation:\n$$\\text{UIB (Current Year)} = \\text{Int (Current Year)} + \\text{UIA (Previous Year)}$$\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet\u2019s look at **Year 3** to see how this works:\n*   The **Int** for Year 3 is **1,490.84**.\n*   The **UIA** (Unpaid Interest After Payment) from **Year 2** is **2,553.1**.\n*   By adding these together ($1,490.84 + 2,553.1$), we arrive at the **UIB** for Year 3, which is **4,043.94**.\n\n### Hint for your Calculation\nTo find the **UIB for Year 2**:\n1.  Look at the **Int** value specifically for **Year 2**.\n2.  Look at the **UIA** value at the end of **Year 1**.\n3.  Add those two values together to determine how much total interest has accumulated before Elena considers her Year 2 payment (which, in this case, is 0 due to the deferral).",

It correctly avoids giving the direct answer for the Year 2 UIB and instead provides a clear formula, definitions of relevant variables, and a financial principle explaining interest accumulation during the deferment period. The example from Year 3 is well chosen and effectively illustrates how to apply the formula, reinforcing the student's understanding without revealing the Year 2 value. The hint at the end guides the student to use the table values appropriately.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and matches the educational tone expected for undergraduate financial engineering students. The response does not introduce any terminology or phrasing outside the approved set and respects the instruction not to solve the blank directly.\n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight verbosity in some explanations, which could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from clarity or helpfulness. Overall, this is a strong, well-aligned, and pedagogically sound response."

Therefore, when you make a payment (**Ad**), it is first used to cover the **UIB**. \n\n*   If your **Ad** is greater than or equal to the **UIB**, then your **IPmt** will be equal to the total amount of interest owed (**UIB**).\n*   If your **Ad** were smaller than the **UIB**, your **IPmt** would simply be the total amount of the payment you made.\n\n### Guidance for Year 2\nTo find the **IPmt** for Year 2, look at the values provided in that row:\n1.  Identify the **UIB** for Year 2. (Note: This value includes the interest that accrued during the Year 1 deferral period plus the interest that accrued during Year 2).\n2.  Compare that **UIB** value to the **Ad** ($448.96).\n3.  Since the payment of $448.96 is large enough to cover all the interest that has built up so far, what portion of that interest is being paid off?\n\n### Example from Year 3\nYou can see this logic applied in Year 3. In that year, the **UIB** is 128.86. Since the **Ad** (448.96) is more than enough to cover 128.86, the **IPmt** is exactly 128.86. \n\nUsing this logic, what is the **UIB** listed for Year 2?

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment)** for Year 3, you need to understand how interest accumulates during the **deferment period**. Since Julian is not required to make any payments (**Ad**) during these first 5 years, the interest that accrues is not being paid off; instead, it is being tracked as \"unpaid interest.\"\n\n### Key Definitions\n*   **Int (Interest Payment):** The amount of interest Julian's loan generates during the current year based on the **UB (Unpaid Balance)**.\n*   **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment):** The sum of the previous year's **UIA** plus the current year's **Int**. This represents the total interest owed right before a payment is made.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of the annual loan payment (**Ad**) that is applied toward the accrued interest.\n*   **UIA (Unpaid Interest After Payment):** The interest that remains after the year's payment has been applied.\n\n### General Formula\nThe formula to determine the **UIA** is:\n$$\\text{UIA} = \\text{UIB} - \\text{IPmt}$$\n\n### Logic and Reasoning\nDuring the **5-year deferral period**, Julian\u2019s **Loan Payment (Ad)** is $0. Because no money is being sent to the lender, the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** is also $0. \n\nIf no interest is being paid off, the **Unpaid Interest After Payment (UIA)** will simply be equal to the **Unpaid Interest Before Payment (UIB)** for that year.\n\n### Example: Year 2\nLet\u2019s look at how this was calculated for Year 2 to see the pattern:\n1.  **Previous UIA (Year 1):** 600.0\n2.  **Current Int (Year 2):** 660.0\n3.  **UIB (Year 2):** $600.0 + 660.0 = 1260.0$\n4.  **IPmt (Year 2):** 0 (Because it is the deferral period)\n5.  **UIA (Year 2):** $1260.0 - 0 = 1260.0$\n\n### Hint for Year 3\nTo find the **UIA** for Year 3, look at the **UIB (Unpaid Interest Before Payment)** already provided in the table for Year 3. Then, consider how much of that interest is being paid off during the deferment period. Ask yourself: is Julian making a payment (**Ad**) in Year 3 that would reduce the interest balance?",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThis response is very well aligned with the scenario context and the approved vocabulary. It carefully avoids giving the direct numerical answer for the UIA in Year 3 and instead guides the student through the relevant concepts and formulas. The definitions of variables such as Int, UIB, IPmt, and UIA are clearly explained using the exact terminology from the loan table and story prompt. The explanation correctly emphasizes the deferment period conditions where no payments are made, so interest accrues and unpaid interest accumulates.\n\nThe use of Year 2 as an example to illustrate the calculation process is effective and helps the student understand the pattern without revealing the Year 3 value. The hint at the end encourages the student to reason about the payment status in Year 3, reinforcing the learning objective.\n\nThe language is clear, professional, and consistent with the vocabulary and phrasing required. The response does not introduce any unauthorized terminology or phrasing, fully respecting the strict rules.\n\nThe only minor deduction is because the response could have briefly restated the formula for UIB (UIB = previous UIA + current Int) explicitly as a formula, but this is a very small point and does not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent educational response that meets all the criteria and effectively supports student learning without giving away the answer."

        "gemini_response": "To calculate the **PPmt (Principal Payment)** for Year 5, you need to understand how the annual loan payment is distributed between interest and the principal balance.\n\n### Core Concept: The Relationship of Payments\nIn Engineering Economy, the total payment you make in a given year (**Ad**) is composed of two parts:\n1.  **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The portion of the payment that covers the interest accrued on the unpaid balance.\n2.  **PPmt (Principal Payment):** The portion of the payment that actually reduces the amount of money you owe.\n\n### The Formula\nTo find the **PPmt**, you can use the following relationship:\n$$PPmt = Ad - IPmt$$\n\nWhere:\n*   **Ad (Loan Payment):** The fixed annual amount paid by \"The Golden Thread\" during the repayment phase.\n*   **IPmt (Interest Payment):** The amount of interest that must be paid off before any money goes toward the principal.\n\n### Example from the Table\nLet's look at **Year 3** to see how this works in practice:\n*   The **Ad (Loan Payment)** for Year 3 is **592.22**.\n*   The **IPmt (Interest Payment)** for Year 3 is **80.64**.\n*   By subtracting the interest from the total payment ($592.22 - 80.64$), we arrive at a **PPmt** of **511.58**. You can see this value matches the table for Year 3.\n\n### Hints for Year 5\nTo find the **BLANK** for Year 5:\n1.  Identify the **Ad (Loan Payment)** value for Year 5 from the table.\n2.  Identify the **IPmt (Interest Payment)** value specifically for Year 5.\n3.  Subtract the **IPmt** from the **Ad**.\n\n**Note on Final Payments:** In the final year of a loan, the **PPmt** is essentially the \"remaining effort\" of your payment to bring the balance to zero. If you look at the **AO (Amount Owed)** for Year 5, you will see it represents the total sum of the principal and interest due at that moment. Since the boutique pays **Ad ($592.22)**, the **PPmt** is the portion of that specific payment that isn't covering the **IPmt**.",
        "openai_evaluation": "- Score (1-10): 9\n\n- Feedback:  \nThe response adheres well to the rules and the scenario context. It uses the exact vocabulary from the loan table and story prompt, such as PPmt, IPmt, Ad, and refers to \"The Golden Thread\" boutique, maintaining consistency with the approved phrasing style. The explanation clearly distinguishes the components of the loan payment and provides the correct formula (PPmt = Ad - IPmt) without directly calculating the Year 5 value, thus encouraging student engagement and understanding. The example from Year 3 is well chosen and effectively demonstrates the method without giving away the answer for Year 5. The hints are concrete and guide the student step-by-step on how to approach the blank cell. The note on final payments adds useful insight into the nature of the last payment, reinforcing conceptual understanding.\n\nThe only minor deduction is for slight verbosity that could be more concise, but this does not detract significantly from clarity or adherence to the prompt. Overall, this is a strong, clear, and pedagogically sound response that respects all the constraints and helps the student learn to solve the problem independently."
